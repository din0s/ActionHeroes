Pflugerville Pets Alive volunteers are the required caretakers needed to ensure the cats are fed, watered, and cleaned two times a day.   The Caretaker volunteers are an essential part of helping cats get homes - the photos and stories from volunteers are an element in them finding their families.  We try to get a least one volunteer to cover each of the 14 shifts at the store.  We have the opportunity for more stores when we have committed volunteers.",

    "description": "The Parent Support & Training Program at Easter Seals Central Texas is offering a Nurturing Parenting Group to support parents through meaningful connection and learning from an evidence-based curriculum. This group will meet every Thursday from 10am to 12pm from March 26 to May 14. In order to make this group a success, we need your help to provide childcare! Caregivers will need to be comfortable providing care to children with a variety of special needs. Childcare happens in our indoor playground room, and we provide plenty of toys and activities for the children. We will ask for all childcare providers to complete a background check. Previous volunteers say that this volunteer opportunity is fun and meaningful!",

    "name": "Plant Walk",
    "description": "Every First Saturday we walk among the plants and point out what is growing, what can be harvested, how to use the medicinal herbs and invite you to be part of the Food Forest family. It's a perfect time for people who have never visited to come and check it out, or for people who have come many times to take home a bag of medicinal herbs and plants to make tea with or add to their meals at home. First Saturdays are a perfect time to connect with the earth, find relief and relaxation from the mechanical world and be taken in by the diverse kaleidoscope of our natural and social systems. We want you to find yourselves inside of something larger, feel the mind-blowing delight from discovering something new about the systems of our earth, and be humbled by the grace and interconnection of it all. An earthen mandala will be generated from your unique expression as it joins with the whole. We invite you to bring a dish or drinks to share (and it's not necessary, whatever shows up is what shows up!). You'll also want to bring a hat, sunscreen, a bottle and plenty of water. See you at the next Plant Walk!",
